## Intro

I am an ecologist studying biodiversity and biogeography in the [Starzomski Lab](https://biodiversity.uvic.ca/) at the University of Victoria.

My research focuses on the integration and mobilization of species occurrence records for understanding where species are, why they're there, and what that means for conservation. I am especially interested in how community science data can work with natural history collection data to improve our understanding of species distribution.

I am a lifelong naturalist with a passion for insects, birds, reptiles & amphibians, and an ever growing interest in plants. My current taxonomic obsession is in the gall wasps (Cynipoidea).
