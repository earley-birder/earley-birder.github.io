## Intro

I am an ecologist studying biodiversity and biogeography. 

My research focuses on the integration and mobilization of species occurrence record data for understanding where species are, why they're there, and what that means for conservation. I am especially interested in how community science data can work with natural history collection data to improve our understanding of species distribution.

I am a lifelong naturalist with a passion for insects, birds, reptiles & amphibians, and a budding interest in plants. My current taxonomic focus is on the gall wasps (Cynipoidea).
