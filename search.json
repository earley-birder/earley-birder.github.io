I’ve been sharing my love of nature for as long as I can remember, leading guided hikes since my early teens. I’m an alumnus of the Natural History Education program in Algonquin Provincial Park, where I worked for four seasons as a Park Naturalist. As an academic science communicator, I draw deeply on my background in nature interpretation. I take pride in my ability to make complex scientific theory, methods, and applications accessible and engaging—without losing sight of the fine details that bring the bigger picture into focus."

    "text": "Research\nI am broadly interested in Biodiversity, Ecology, Evolution, and Natural History. and am especially interested in where, when, and why species are where they are.\n\nPhD research\nMy PhD research investigates the usefulness of diverse species occurrence datasets and how these datasets differ and can be used together to improve our understanding of species distributions. My research uses comparative analyses of data from the community science platform iNaturalist with traditional species occurrence datasets including natural history collections and governmental invasive species monitoring. My work will improve our ability to balance the value and limitations of community science data. Understanding how community science data can be mobilized for biodiversity assessment will improve our ability to react to global biodiversity changes and prescribe conservation initiatives where and when they matter the most.\n\n\nMSc research\nMy MSc research investigated the eco-evolutionary drivers of parasitoid host range for two adventive parasitoids (Hym.: Figitidae) proposed for the biological control of the agricultural pest Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae). My work focused on identifying the diversity of drosophilids that may come into contact with the parasitoids, testing and quantifying the fundamental and ecological host ranges of the parasitoids when exposed to non-target drosophilid larvae, and investigating the differences in ovipositor morphology between the parasitoids. I found that one parasitoid had a broad host range, making it an inappropriate biological control agent. I also found that the parasitoid with the broader host range had a significantly longer ovipositor than the more host specific parasitoid which may present a mechanism for niche-partitioning among the two apparent competitors.\n\n\nBSc research\nI was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to conduct two independent research projects during my BSc.\nIn my Honours, I used molecular methods to identify the diversity and distribution of the parasitoid genus Eurytoma (Hym.: Eurytomidae) reared from Diplolepis variabilis (Hym.: Diplolepididae) galls in the Okanagan valley. I found that the diversity of Eurytoma was higher in the north than in the south and found showed that the extended emergence of Okanagan Eurytoma was driven by a parthenogenic species that emerged after all other species had completed their emergence, perhaps due to a host shift from gall inducer to inquiline (Earley et al 2023).\nIn my Directed studies research, I ran camera traps in green spaces on the UBC - Okanagan campus and recorded the temporal behaviour of vertebrates. I found that Coyote and Mule Deer records increased on campus at night from Sunday to Wednesday but did not increase at night from Thursday to Saturday."
