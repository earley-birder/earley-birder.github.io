My research compares and contrasts data from the community science data (iNaturalist) with traditional species occurrence datasets (natural history collections, governmental invasive species monitoring) to understand how their integration may improve conservation prioritization. Overall, my work will improve our ability to balance the value and limitations of community science data. Understanding how these data can be mobilized for biodiversity assessment will improve our ability to react to biodiversity changes and prescribe conservation initiatives where and when they matter the most.\n\n\n\nMy MSc research investigated the eco-evolutionary drivers of parasitoid host range for two adventive parasitoids (Hym.: Figitidae) proposed for the biological control of the agricultural pest Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae). My work focused on identifying the diversity of drosophilids that may be exposed to the parasitoids, testing and quantifying the fundamental and ecological host ranges of the parasitoids, and investigating the differences in ovipositor morphology between the parasitoids. I found that one parasitoid had a broad host range, making it an inappropriate biological control agent. I also found that the parasitoid with the broader host range had a significantly longer ovipositor than the more host specific parasitoid which presents a possible mechanism for niche-partitioning among the two apparent competitors.\n\n\n\nI conducted two independent research projects during my BSc.\nIn my Honours, I used molecular methods to identify the diversity and distribution of the parasitoid genus Eurytoma (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae) reared from Diplolepis variabilis (Hymenoptera: Diplolepididae) galls in the Okanagan valley, British Columbia. I found that the diversity of Eurytoma was higher in the north than in the south. I also found that the extended emergence of Okanagan Eurytoma was driven by one parthenogenic species that emerged after all other species had completed their emergence, perhaps due to a host shift from gall inducer to inquiline (Earley et al 2023).\nIn my directed studies research, I ran camera traps in green spaces on the UBC-Okanagan campus and recorded the temporal behaviour of vertebrates. I found that Coyote and Mule Deer records increased on campus at night from Sunday to Wednesday but did not increase at night from Thursday to Saturday."
